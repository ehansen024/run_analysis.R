CODEBOOK

Each variable in the dataset is broken down into the following four parts:
1.	Calculation. The data set contains calculations of either the mean or the standard deviation of each measurement. The relevant calculation is denoted by one of the following:
        a.	Mean
        b.	StDev
2.	Measurement. A combination of measurements was taken for each subject. The acceleration signals were separated into ‘Body’ and ‘Gravity’ using a low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3Hz.  Additional ‘Jerk’ signals were derived using the body linear acceleration and angular velocity. ‘Time’ domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz and filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. ‘FrequencyDomain’ pertains to the frequency domain signals obtained when applying  a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the ‘body’  and ‘jerk’ signals. The combination of these variables are as follows:
        a.	BodyTime
        b.	GravityTime
        c.	BodyJerkTime
        d.	BodyFrequencyDomain
        e.	BodyJerkFrequencyDomain
3.	Type of raw signal. The measurements in the data set come from either accelerometer or gyroscope  raw signals.
        a.	Accelerometer
        b.	Gyroscope
4.	Dimension. The raw signals were taken on each of three axes. The magnitude of the signals was also calculated using the Euclidean norm.
        a.	Xaxis
        b.	Yaxis
        c.	Zaxis
        d.	Magnitude
